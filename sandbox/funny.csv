dr0rciv,dr0uxh0,">	[David] Robinson was 6 ft. 8 in. when he was admitted to the Naval Academy, two inches above the height limit, but received a waiver from the Superintendent of the Academy. Robinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve in active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, hurting his naval career, and might make it impossible for him to be commissioned at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive his commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps community. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserves and had to serve only an initial active-duty obligation for two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia.[5] He was regularly featured in recruiting materials for the service. Despite the nickname ""Admiral"", Robinson's actual rank upon fulfilling his service commitment was Lieutenant, Junior Grade.

dr0q56f,dr0wk67,"Lol. You’re not wrong, but it’s probably because so many guys have said they were 5’11” when they’re actually 5’7”.  Especially in online dating situations. 

If a guy says they’re 6’1” or taller, they’re usually being honest, but 5’8” to 6’0” tends to lend itself to embellishment. 

Such a weird thing to lie about, because it’s not like people won’t know you’re lying the second you meet. And it makes you look insecure, which is way less attractive than dating a shorter guy. 

TLDR: just be honest about your height. ",Positive
