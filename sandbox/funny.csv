dr1kj8r,dr1opoh,"I hope you already have this on your mind, but let me be absolutely clear: The moment you decide to use your drone around other people you're likely to bother them to some degree.

Do it during a medieval convention and you're basically guaranteed to bother people.

This has absolutely nothing to do with safety, let alone legal rights. In fact if you believe it's okay to bother other people on the basis that you have the legal right to do so, you're quite simply an asshole.

If you want to use your drone around other people, talking to those people beforehand goes a long way. Explain what you're doing, why you're doing it and for how long you're going to do it. Even if those people aren't happy about it for some reason, there's likely some compromise to be found. And on the off chance that they decide to be assholes about it, you can still reconsider your approach to that situation.",Positive
