7ioowt,dr0entw,"I'm a regular at multiple bars and stores on Foster. There's already a ton of car camping, ally camps, squatting, and porch sleeping going on. Seen tweeked out dudes wandering the street. Seen local businesses kick crusty people out. Seen bars come and go because they were meth fronts. Seen prostitutes walking the street. Seen bikes picked clean.

I can't really see a shelter making the neighborhood worse.",Negative
7ioowt,dr0dbma,"I am a local here and I am totally having mixed feelings too. Good, even great in theory, good for the city and the people, but that nimby spectre rises up and I think about how I already spend 1 morning in 3 picking up garbage from in front of my house.

There are a whole bunch of local campers here, they move around. Even a green minivan that is like a mobile drug den. Dunno if those are the sorts of folks who will be sheltering. I think the shelter is for the large portion of the homeless who are trying not to be, rather than the small group of assholes who would be assholes even if they lived in apartments.

And to be honest, the trash is mostly fast food bags dropped in the middle of the night after strip club trips. I do hope that anybody reading this who has ever done that secretly feels a stab of shame. It sucks.

One thing for sure: that 7-11 there is gonna get extra tragic.",Positive
7ioowt,dr0ig1u,"Does shit generally go down at homeless shelters in Portland? I can't say I've ever read about anything, though obviously the organized outdoor camps seem to have plenty of issues.

Foster has so much potential. ",Negative
7ioowt,dr0ibx9,"I sold my house off foster and 60th three months ago. The police already ignore that area entirely. I made this comment [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/7id7ev/how_to_help_unfuck_portland/dqxz44e/) sharing some of the experiences I had. 

It was so hard for me to sell that house- I completely gutted a 1906 home and restored it including scraping lead based paint off window frames and trim, mitigating asbestos, matching the original trim down to the type of grain, six months on a ladder restoring the plaster ceiling, ect. All that nasty stuff people want others to do to save old homes. I went to every community association meeting, I volunteered with the community garden.  

In spite of my love for the neighborhood I left because there were a couple of big things that happened - the first being that our family is growing and I didn't want to take on a basement rehab at the time. This was not my first DIY restoration of an old house, I'd suffered through worse but the additional factors of rising crime and being completely screwed over by the city were not things I couldn't fix. 

This proposal was a rumor at a neighbor association meeting over a year ago, although the spot was down the road. My thoughts at the time are the same now. The city has to commit more resources to Foster and surrounding neighbors. Neighborhoods with sanctioned camps and shelters should go to the top of the list for city resources. 

* Not just police, but that's number one on the list. They are available for BS in fancy neighborhoods but we can't get them to come out for robberies in progress. 
* Abandoned cars sit for literal months and sometimes over a year in Foster. The excuse from the city was  that there's only one investigator for all of SE.
* Street resources actually need to show up. There was a sinkhole on a city street that was large enough that a neighbor blocked children from playing in by pushing a fucking shopping cart into it. The city wanted to wait until the sewer work to fix it- that was going to be two years later. It took multiple people calling to get something that dangerous fixed.

The thing is- I like shelters and camps, having them in one area gives them access to resources and keeps them out of random areas (like under porches). If done correctly they are a win for everyone. But the city seems to be completely incompetent when placing these shelters. The best things about Foster and surrounding areas were started by local groups with the city taking a backseat and offering resources - see the community gardens, the mercado, the streetscape projects. The worst parts are when the city or developers try to do something without the input of the residents- see the bowling alley being replaced with a target, the nursery turning into storage.

TLDR; Place the shelters in area that aren't already being screwed over by the city, if there aren't enough resources for current residents how can we support more people who will need far more resources than the average resident? ",Negative

7ioowt,dr0catl,And why not have it be assisted with job outreach programs and rehab facilities? This truly has to be an opportunity for people to rebound with the idea that if you truly want to get back on your feet this will be your opportunity to do so by being able to use the shelter's address and phone number for jobs and be connected to drug rehab services. You get a place to sleep and eat but you have to stay clean and provide jobs you're applying to. It's no doubt wishful thinking but if we give the opportunity maybe more than a few could be helped and in long term ways?

As someone who lives in a ""fancy neighborhood"" (the Pearl), let me tell you that the police are just as shittily responsive to low-level calls here as they are anywhere else in Portland.

For about 3 months, we had a set of criddlers who repeatedly broke into the building via an attached public parking garage. Literally 7 separate incidents over this time, including numerous vehicles broken into, graffiti, tripped fire alarms, and signage set on fire. Las month, they took a bunch of stuff stolen out of someone's car into the stairwell and proceeded to torch it, setting fire to the walls and setting off the sprinkler system.

That became a felony (arson on an occupied building), which *finally* prompted some sort of response from the police in the form of an arson investigator. Once that happened? They got fantastic!

The problem is that before it got that far, repeated break-ins, vandalism, and low level arson prompted absolutely zero response. This was the same group of people, commiting these crimes regularly, costing us thousands of dollars (and even more if you include all the car break-ins), and we had the whole thing on video, with evidence... and the cops did not give a fuck.",Positive

We were told that it was going to be a women's shelter that would be well managed and drugs and alchohol would not be permitted.  A year in, and the 100 beds increased to 120, it's now a ""low barrier"" shelter meaning that people can walk in day or night as drunk or tweaked out as they want.  It's now a ""couples shelter"" which sees fit to allow level three sex offenders to stay there.  There have been all sorts of complaints about drug dealing within the shelter, and people shooting up in the park across the street and the bathrooms of nearby businesses.  The grocery store had to change their hours in an effort to stem the now constant theft. Theft in the neighborhood has increased exponentially.  Home insurance and car insurance has increased with higher crime rates.  If I could go back in time, I would have sold my home and gotten out the minute the center was announced.",Negative
