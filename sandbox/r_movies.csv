Obi-Wan, like Logan is a character that is beloved by many for his portrayal and what he represents, and if they can expand on that by focusing on character conflicts it could result in a great product.",Positive
dr0uk7f,dr0x6rw,"I guess part of the low-stakes is that they're just focusing on saving a kid (and later group of kids). We don't really see the broader repercussions of these actions in terms of how they will affect the world as a whole, so I think the lower stakes are because of the narrowed focus of the movie. It's possible that saving this small group of kids will not have much of an effect on the world, since the elimination of the mutant gene from the altered corn syrup will still continue and the large corporation behind the project likely did not completely depend on the men killed in the final battle.



We aren't really given enough information about the state of mutants in the world, aside from the fact that no mutants have been born in a long time and most (if not all) of the X-Men are dead. I think the lack of information really helps keep the focus on the particular characters and a smaller mission that could potentially be part of a larger storyline that has world-altering consequences.

dr0xq1z,dr0zs3o,">A young Kenobi movie has way more potential

I disagree, a young Kenobi movie would have to be before Phantom Menace.  When there were no Sith in the open, and no great threat.  It would have to be a pretty generic movie about him facing a threat that wasn't important to the later stories.  Plus, Liam Neeson is quite a bit older than he was in the Phantom Menace, so while not impossible it would be odd for him to reprise the role of Qui-Gon Jinn.

But, with a 20 year gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope there is time for adventures for Obi Wan.  It could be that an Imperial Officer or Inquisitor discovers information about Luke and Obi-Wan has to stop him before he can take the information to the Emperor.  Or the settlement Luke is in could become the target of a crime syndicate and Obi-Wan has to fight them.  Or to tie the film into the sequels, Luke could catch the attention of someone affiliated with Snoke.  

*Edit:  Thinking about it more, I think this idea would annoy some people but depending on how he is portrayed in the Last Jedi, I would enjoy seeing Obi-Wan face off against a young Snoke.  Perhaps Obi-Wan being the source of Snoke's giant scar.  It would also be fun if it turns out Obi-Wan disfigured three of the most powerful dark side users: Maul, Vader and Snoke.*",Positive

dr0swaz,dr0wy8j,"I watched this one Youtube video about how a movie or plot/narrative gains weight. And when a story centers around the ""end of the world"" it loses all weight. The heroes are obviously going to win. But when it is something much more simple, like missing a kid's recital or killing a mob boss' kid, it becomes more tangible and more possible. And when we accept a possible outcome as a real possibility we suddenly care. 

With that in mind, a story of Obi-Wan protecting baby Luke and the Lars ranch just won't be good. We know what happens. 

But a story about someone like Satine (which I love that they named her that in Star Wars, as Ewan did Moulin Rouge during the prequels and Nicole Kidman's character was named Satine) and their romance/drama would be so much more interesting as her life or death doesn't matter to the main story. It only matters to Obi-wan- so we would care much more, and the outcomes would make us engaged.
