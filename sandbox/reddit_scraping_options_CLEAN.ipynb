      "Reply: The gaps thing is weird to me because people (Portlanders especially for some reason) use them wrong. In a slow-rolling traffic jam, the goal is to keep moving, never coming to a complete stop (to avoid creating traffic waves). So the gaps are useful as buffers; when the car ahead of you stops or slows, you roll into your buffer with the hope that by the time you get there, it's moving again and you didn't have to stop. Then you re-establish the buffer. For some reason Portlanders tend to maintain the gaps, they don't roll into them. So for all intents and purposes, there may as well be a car in that gap if you never roll into it, and you're not really helping traffic flow at all.

      "The gaps thing is weird to me because people (Portlanders especially for some reason) use them wrong. In a slow-rolling traffic jam, the goal is to keep moving, never coming to a complete stop (to avoid creating traffic waves). So the gaps are useful as buffers; when the car ahead of you stops or slows, you roll into your buffer with the hope that by the time you get there, it's moving again and you didn't have to stop. Then you re-establish the buffer. For some reason Portlanders tend to maintain the gaps, they don't roll into them. So for all intents and purposes, there may as well be a car in that gap if you never roll into it, and you're not really helping traffic flow at all. (Contrary opinions are welcome, I've just thought a lot about this topic for some reason.)\n",

Every other city the size of Portland (New Orleans, for example) has a bypass freeway to avoid exactly what hat we’re dealing with. It’s time to try something else. Restrict semi trucks to night time hours on I-5 in aportkand perhaps? \n",

      "The gaps thing is weird to me because people (Portlanders especially for some reason) use them wrong. In a slow-rolling traffic jam, the goal is to keep moving, never coming to a complete stop (to avoid creating traffic waves). So the gaps are useful as buffers; when the car ahead of you stops or slows, you roll into your buffer with the hope that by the time you get there, it's moving again and you didn't have to stop. Then you re-establish the buffer. For some reason Portlanders tend to maintain the gaps, they don't roll into them. So for all intents and purposes, there may as well be a car in that gap if you never roll into it, and you're not really helping traffic flow at all.

Then you re-establish the buffer. For some reason Portlanders tend to maintain the gaps, they don't roll into them.

Given that there are a fair number of criminals/predators in the homeless community (even without a criminal record to show it), and a fair number of sexual assault survivors, it's not an ideal situation. Start up costs do not include a solution to this issue. Not letting families stay together could be rather damaging to their mental health, making recovery more difficult. There's a decent sized homeless population of single adults, but this wouldn't be a good solution for families without redesign. As to pets, it might be easier to accommodate. But a bunch of potentially unruly dogs in a single room? Could be a messy. Families /pets would have to be the ones camping outside if they're accommodated here at all.

They've gotten the FS to do a project, spend public dollars on assessment, research, paperwork, in order to open a route climbing on the North side of the mountain. Is it open to the public? No! You must go through the Mount St. Helens Institute. Cost? $300. Sure, that's equitable and fair... A fucking travesty you must pay a private organization to access public land. \n",
