    "1. Emoticons were removed from the Sentiment140 database but were NOT removed from the SemEval database. This could cause the model to pick up on that sequence of characters (ie. :(, =)) as defining features. Should remove.\n",
    "2. Definitely some tweets I would say are miscategorized. For example: 'I love my sister a.k.a brianna!!! Missing her..we might be away by distance,never in heart..' is labeled Negative due to the presence of a :( in the original tweet. The accuracy of any model trying to predict Positive/Negative Sentiment on this corpus will consistently struggle to approach perfection due to these types of labels.\n",
    "3. The general sentence structure here is grammatically awful and may not translate well to Reddit where individuals tend to hold more of a long-form conversation. "

Most states with income tax do this - if you live in or work in the state, you're taxed by that state.  Actually it might literally be all states with income tax, not sure.  Deal with it, or get a job in WA and don't deal with the taxes OR commuting back and forth across the bridge.  \n",

      "Basically, the idea of induced demand is that if you build more freeway capacity it won't help traffic because eventually you will just have more cars on the road. People who weren't driving before suddenly will, and more people will move into the area because more freeway capacity usually also means more development, more housing, stores, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a lot of times that's true, plenty of big cities have seen that happen. They build more freeways and then development sprawls out in those areas and before long the traffic problem is just as bad as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference with Portland is the Urban Growth Boundary. There is a 'border' for sprawl around the metro area, and development beyond it is pretty heavily restricted. So hypothetically, if you built a new freeway out to McMinnville, without the UGB before long Newberg would look like Beaverton, tons of subdivisions and tons of traffic to go along with it. With the UGB, a new freeway does not necessarily mean new development, and so the problem of induced demand may not happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, is Portland's UBG enough to stop the forces of development that go along with a new freeway? I don't think we really have an answer to that question. For a new freeway to go in somewhere there would have to be a pretty significant demand from people living and driving in that area already, so it's kind of a chicken and egg issue. Freeways encourage development, but they probably won't get built in an area that doesn't already have development in the first place. The UGB holds back development, so it kind of naturally holds back development of new freeways as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day though, all of this is getting pretty far out into the weeds. The proposed Rose Quarter project is a far cry from a new freeway, and it's undeniable that there is a significant bottleneck in that area. Plus it's not like there's empty land around it that's suddenly going to be developed. It's a fairly routine traffic management proposal, it's just that there is a small but vocal group in Portland that is opposed to any road expansion of any kind. Personally I'd always prefer to see a new MAX line go in somewhere rather than building a new major road or freeway, but fixing the Rose Quarter interchange seems like a no-brainer.\n",

      "Induced demand is key concept in urban planning wrt transit planning. The idea is that if you expand roads that more people use them. One of the thoughts is that by creating a bigger road you allow people to live further and further away from the city center. If people are ok with a 45 minute commute and you allow them to go 10 more miles in that time then they'll sprawl out another 10 miles. You end up with more and more sprawled metros and the traffic never gets better since people are doing more vehicles miles per capita. It's pretty well studied, but I haven't seen a study from Portland and we do have some unique constraints here. How does it play out in a growth constrained metro such as Portland with our Urban Growth Boundary. We'll never have exurbs here and even our suburbs are quite dense compared to a lot of areas. We're not Dallas and we're not Atlanta so comparing traffic patterns there isn't real helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not entirely discounting the concept since it seems to be valid to some extent anywhere you go. I'd just like to see it studied in Portland before our regional planners use it to shape the next decades of mobility here.\n",

      "I actually lived in Atlanta at the time of the Olympics, maybe 96 or 98, somewhere in there.  They basically doubled the size of the road system inside the perimeter. The perimeter is the nickname for I-285 that goes around the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "That road expansion was nice for about 18 months but after that everything was just as crowded as before. Now there was the added bonus of being stuck in traffic while you commute from inside the perimeter to being stuck in traffic and commuting from outside the perimeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason was that the improved roadway incentivized people in a bunch of different ways to drive more. The expanded road system encouraged a building boom b/c you could commute from further suburbs just as quickly as you could from inside the perimeter. Until too many people had moved there and then you couldn't. Business's could set up more easily outside the perimeter b/c greater roadways allowed them the access they needed so there was more truck and business traffic as well as the the residential commuters.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The lower housing costs from the housing boom expanded Atlanta's economy. The better job market drew people to move there. \n",
      "\n",
      "So better jobs, more business, cheaper housing, and probably some other stuff I'm not thinking of, were all stimulated by the road expansion.  That caused the excess road capacity to be used. And suddenly there wasn't excess road capacity anymore. There were just longer traffic jams.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why a lot of people argue that increasing roads doesn't decrease congestion. It just incentivizes more people to drive. That's where the argument about the urban growth boundary comes in. If you can't expand outside of a certain area then there'd be less incentive to use the capacity. I don't exactly buy that argument but the traffic on North bound I-5 also isn't driven by road capacity. \n",
      "\n",
      "People point out it's a choke point, and that's correct, but what's incentiving people to drive through it I think has more to do with Portland housing prices and the way the Vancouver economy works. A lot of the people making that commute have to make a choice between paying for housing, having a good job, or having a decent commute. If you don't have housing it's hard to hold a decent job. So you have to go with the housing to provide almost everything else. The commute follows as a result.\n",

A major traffic corridor like that will absolutely suffer from induced demand, unless it went from two lanes to six or seven maybe. Currently, so many people take the max because of that I5 bottleneck. Widening it will just siphon some people off the train into that same bottleneck and the traffic jam will remain.\n",

Sure, people drive to Jantzen beach/Hayden Meadows, the Costco out in NE, but that traffic doesn't impact highway 26, I-84, I-5, 217 nearly as much as Oregon residents.  The Costco's and Walmarts and grocery stores in Vancouver are always packed.  The problem isn't as big as this thread is making it out to be.  I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact, I'm just saying that I believe the 60k+ people moving to the Portland metro area every year is probable having a greater impact. \n",

      "I thought induced demand was the phenomenon where new freeways or freeway lanes will cause people, who already live in a given area, to stop using alternate means of transport.  People who were driving into work an hour early to beat traffic will decide to resume driving during rush hour.  People who took MAX/bus/bike will decide to resume driving a car.  etc.\n",
      "THis seems like a real concern even with a UGB.\n",

Pop goes up by 25%, increase freeway capacity by 15%, for example.\n",

Without expanding the UGB at all, there's enough available land for development, ready to go, without much of a nudge.  Is relieving the current pressure caused by the traffic bottleneck in the Rose Quarter enough of a nudge?  It might be.  I think it's worth considering.\n",

Or some people might shop at a big box store at the other end of the metro instead of a local shop or ordering online from amazon. Or someone might travel at 9am instead of 10am when they go shopping. Or someone who takes bus/max to work might start driving if traffic gets lighter etc...Increased demand for road use after highway expansions doesn't juts come from new people.

And the urban growth boundary has been expanded in the past, and it's planned to be expanded in the future. There isn't any reason to think latent demand and induced demand will not play out following highway expansions in the PDX metro.\n",

So being sceptical of freeway widening being the answer to traffic problems is usually wise. It's just in this case that scepticism has kind of run amok. If the plan was to add a lane to I-5 from Wilsonville to Vancouver that's where you go, huh, will that really help? Adding a lane over a short distance to remove a narrowing of a major artery is a very different proposition.\n",

      "It's very easy for the boundary to be expanded because it's designed to be expanded. If the UGB didn't grow along with the population of the metro area we would have a housing crisis of epic proportions. If you think Portland is unaffordable now, imagine if there hadn't been any development in the suburbs over the last few decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, it's designed to be expanded in small chunks. The boundary is set by the Metro Council, a 7 member body that is elected by the people who live within the boundary. Every few years they have a vote of the council to decide on expanding the boundary. Their goal is to make sure there is always enough open land inside the boundary to allow for expected development of the metro area for the next 20 years. So if they do their research and determine that in the next 20 years we'll need 10K acres of land and there are only 8K available, they will likely vote to expand the boundary to include an additional 2K acres.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Metro Council works with cities and counties to determine where the growth areas are and whether adding more land to the UGB is a good idea. There are always various constituencies battling over whether the UGB should expand or not. Most Oregonians don't like the idea of Portland turning into Phoenix. That said, the council are certainly influenced by business and home builders as well, so there are pressures to expand. Usually the council votes for modest increases in the UGB. They'll add on a small amount of land on the border in an area that's growing, but they won't add huge swaths of land to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's always a tricky balance. Adding too much land will make the UGB meaningless, and we'll have the same sprawl problems that other large cities have struggled with, not to mention the environmental impact. Don't add enough land and housing becomes an even bigger problem than it already is, more land in the UGB means more housing which will ease at least some of the pressure driving prices up.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone is interested in this issue, now is the time to start paying attention. The last time the Council voted on expansion in 2015 they left the boundary as is. The next vote is coming up in 2018. There will be a lot of pressure on them to expand to deal with the housing shortage.\n",

Portland Metro is a much more livable space than a lot of big cities I've visited, and I think the UGB is a huge part of why.

I like to think in terms of \"what if everyone did this?\" If everyone merges at the front, 1 car from one lane, then 1 from the other, both lanes move at the same speed, and congestion stays up where people can still get off at the RQ exit. If everyone merges further back however, this will either cause congestion to be pushed back onto the bridge, where the rose-quarter-goers will need to wait needlessly, or it will cause the through lane to move slower because people will have to \"leapfrog\" ahead of cars already merged (which is what generally happens now).\n",

If today our roads can provide X people the ability to move around the city, and improving the road system means that 1.3 * X will be able to move around instead, I see that as improving the lives of those 0.3 * X people. Even if \"traffic\" doesn't get \"fixed\" by it, it didn't get worse, and more people are benefiting, so it seems like a complete win to me.\n",

      "I'm always impressed at how people don't understand the flow dynamics onto the bridge over the 5. The jantzen onramp is trash, the ramp from marine drive is right in front of it. The interstate onramp is also right there. you're basically hammering traffic onto the freeway right before the bridge, and that's creating traffic jam conditions. People merging always causes slowdowns, and three of them? yeah, that's murder. Then there's the vancouver side, where you've got the ramp from downtown and mill plain, and for all that the ramp is long from downtown, the actual merge space is maybe 40-60 feet long. it's worthless. They should force the merge down to two lanes before the bridge on both sides, washington at 4th plain, oregon at interstate avenue. That would give plenty of time for the people getting on at the onramps. I'd like to see testing.\n",

The Oregonian inability/unwillingness to zipper-merge is sooo frustrating.  There's a sign on the on-ramp to St John's Bridge that says, \"use both lanes in congestion,\" (which requires a zipper-merge) because otherwise Oregonians will default to a single lane and backup traffic onto 30.  It's a fucking disgrace.  I think ODOT needs to mount some kind of public education campaign.
