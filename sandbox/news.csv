> Or any of the other hundreds of mobile games that use a RNG style microtransaction system?

There are many distinct systems being used and each should be considered by their specific details. But yes, many mobile games use systems that meet my definition of microtransaction gambling and I think we need to enact laws against them.

> Or do you only now care because it might personally affect you and put you at a 10% damage disadvantage?

No. I dont play any competitive games where players can pay for boosts -- reguadless of whether these boosts are paid for directly or gambled -- and I never will. To me that violates the fundimental purpose of competition.

I'm writing because humanity has never encountered behavior engineering systems as effective as these and I'm very worried about that. I don't think the average person has a sense of agency that's anywhere near as strong as we want to imagine. 

For example, my mom is a 60 year old country lady who has always been uncomfortable around computers. I watched her get completely addicted to Farmville and Facebook slot machine games. The addictive patterns in these games overcame her fear of technology and dominate her life now.

I think we're going to be surprised by how many people will be financially harmed if we don't do something to reign in these dark patterns. People who are depressed, don't have a lot going on, or feel like they are in control -- these people are in serious danger of having their agency overloaded by dark patterns so they can be financially exploited.

We need to acknowledge the threat these patterns represent to agency and stop pretending that all men have an absolute power of free thought. This is an uncomfortable idea for most people because we want to believe that we're special little snow flakes gifted by the Divine spark with an unassailable power to choose. 

This just isn't the reality.

We've learned that much of our mind operates on simple programing logic. When you break our decision making processes down to the discreet level, you can see that we all function pretty much the same way. This knowledge has empowered us to develop disturbingly effective behavior engineering systems, and the digital world has allowed us to automate them on a global scale. It is now nearly instantaneous for us to test these systems, interpret the results, and revise them to be more effective. We have overwhelming data showings that these behavior engineering systems work and that they are far more powerful that most people want to believe. 

This is a rising threat that most people aren't really aware of yet. It would be wise to address it before it produces wide spread financial harm across society. Financial harm always trickles down to become social harm. ",Positive

dr3misb,dr3q7tm,"Dang.  If I wasn't poor and or a cheapskate, I would give you gold straight away.  You clearly articulated what I have been thinking since Gore ran for office.

Well done.",Negative
dr3misb,dr3prgi,Shut up science nerd!,Positive
dr3misb,dr3ur6a,"That sword works both way, FYI. The Dems/Libs are better at swaying the younger generation right now because of their use of buzzwords and their ""painting of a better tomorrow"". Reps/Cons are taking in the older generations because of the straight talk and the ""the world is coming to an end because of all the changes"". 

In reality, both are painting pretty pictures for the votes they want and dividing the nation works best for both parties as it prevents people from coming together and solving all the problems. I'm not going into a conspiracy rant here, but look at how a single news media can twist a story for both sides depending on where it is broadcasting/selling. In fact, I think it was the NYTimes that was caught doing it with their newspaper a few months ago. 

A divided people make for better business and better profit. 

Both parties are good at playing the game, right now it is just easier to point at the Reps because they are the top dogs in the game. ",Positive
dr3yozy,dr3z3xx,There is not always a choice for ISP though.,Negative
dr3yozy,dr41o77,"“If the ISPs collude”

It’s not an “if”. It’s never been an “if”. The whole system naturally develops into either a monopoly, duopoly, or an oligopoly. I would bet money that the CEOs of the telecoms trade wives and print passes for their daughters.",Positive
dr3z7u5,dr3zywa,"Looks like im done with facebook. 

The only way we can stop it if it is repealed, they realize people are not buying their packages and end up losing more than their already shitty services and offered packages. 

Now, i doubt the masses outside of who cares about this will do this but it is the action we ahould take. You want us to pay? Fuck it, we dont need facebook and all the others. Lets go back to newspapers and communicating with mail. ",Negative
dr3zaz8,dr409dw,"I spoke with someone who made a good point - if they do shed the common carrier classification, they also lose its protections - they are directly responsible for anything illegal that traverses their networks.

It's not going to happen I'm sure, but it would be humorous to see a lawsuit filed shortly afterwards regarding this.",Positive
dr3xw09,dr3xziq,I cumquered. Wait...,Negative
dr3xd6z,dr3y2dv,"I mean. I've only been spending the last several years mailing, emailing, protesting, calling my local politicians and generally trying to do my part in educating and stopping the removal of Net neutrality. Ive done my part. The battle seems to be lost and Im gonna go enjoy a movie for a few hours and try to take my mind off of the shit future that's coming our way. If that makes me dense. Call me a fucking prequel scene. ",Negative
dr3xd6z,dr3yk6o,"Thanks, I was really considering, I'm not sure what exactly I'm hearing lol.",Positive
dr3xj1u,dr3yhpl,"Look... You do you, but it would take a blind man to have not seen this coming from a mile away. I'm not sure why you felt like telling me the story, but cheers, enjoy the movie.",Negative
dr3ur6a,dr3v47t,"I think this is false. ""painting a better tomorrow"" is not some buzzword or lofty ideal, it's something that I believe most people can agree on. We need to stop with the ""both sides"" derailment of the argument",Positive
dr3ur6a,dr3w9vy,While the republicans seem worse right now I'm inclined to agree with you. Perhaps more parties or better yet no parties would solve this but I can't see how to actually make that happen.,Negative
dr3z3xx,dr3z923,"That's exactly why these net neutrality repeals won't work. Republicans are saying that if one ISP is being dirty, go to another. That doesn't work when something like 70% of people only have access to 1-2 ISP's...",Negative
dr3z3xx,dr43xgw,"Exactly. I have 1 choice and that’s Comcast. Because of where I live, they charge $80/month for 14-16mb down. I’d gladly change ISPs, but my only option would be to sell a house that’s still nowhere near recovering from the housing bubble. Comcast is the Devil. Trust them to do the right thing without net neutrality?  Whatever :(",Negative
dr3z3xx,dr42qr7,"In fact, in my experience there is *rarely* a choice for ISP. ",Negative
dr3z3xx,dr4443r,People think that this is be case in some remote places in the US. But I live in the Bay Area and I have exactly one choice for isp. Comcast. I also technically have access to att over dsl with the astounding speeds of 3mbps. Gtfo. ,Positive
dr41o77,dr43ogd,"So much this. Whenever the idea of CEOs colluding to take something down or whatever comes up its always refuted as being a conspiracy theory. Yet conspiracy is in our legal code. It is no mystery that these people meet in rooms and knowingly support and put these policies into law. The ruling elites have been and always will collide with one another to protect their common interest, profit.",Positive
