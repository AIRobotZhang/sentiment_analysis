dr1dadt,dr1dvm8,"Edit: DISCLAIMER - you have to do this immediately upon discovering you have bedbugs. Things only get out of hand when people put it off until the next day. When they feed they breed, and they lay 8 (?) eggs at a time. The baby ones feed on you too, and develop quickly so you can see how things will get out of hand. 

Unless someone is pulling the world’s most horrific prank on you, when you start out there is probably only one bedbug there. Worse case scenario is that it is an already pregnant female. So you begin by taking all your bedding and basically cooking it, and then *very* methodically wiping/spraying down every inch of your bed and mattress with rubbing alcohol. Get diatomaceous earth and put that in any cracks in the bed frame that you can’t reach. 

Bedbugs are basically very well designed machines with a very predictable program. So if your bedbugs aren’t in your bed, they they are absolutely going to come out of hiding when you are sleeping every 2-3 days to feed. So to that end you make yourself the bait (they hate light and are drawn to the carbon dioxide you produce when you breath), and any avenue on to your bed into a trap. All you need to do to ensure this happens is either surround your bed frame/legs of your bed with diatomaceous earth, or simply double sided tape. 

They don’t go after pets. They can’t problem solve. You’ll hear that they climb up walls and drop on to people, but this is either something that was observed in a lab or bullshit. Either way they’re just bugs. Eventually they will hit the trap because the only thing they know how to do is go straight towards the carbon dioxide. They can’t climb glossy surfaces, and they aren’t very strong (though they are very hard to smash).

Most of the stress with bedbugs is the whole “where are they? How many are there?” panic that sets in. So if you behave logically and don’t start tearing apart your home it’s no worse than having a particularly vicious mosquito in your room for a week or two. 

If you are crafty you can also build a trap with a live yeast culture (to produce carbon dioxide) and double sided tape, diatomaceous earth, or a little tray of mineral oil for them to fall in to. Then you can make your room dark when you’re at work and they’ll go for that during the day. ",Positive

We have mostly Volunteer Fire a good chunk of volunteer EMS and one of the remaining in our state and as far as I can tell probably in the country volunteer hazardous materials team. We have an on-call program in which at any moment a duty officer can be paged for consultation or response services. I happened to be the on-call during this time. Be mindful I'm truncating about a week's worth of investigating so there is a bit of time lapse. 

This all started several years ago I received a page to consult with a local fire chief who was at a local Middle School. There was a report of an odor that could be best described as a Sharpie. I grabbed another duty officer who was bored and wanted to lend a hand and we set off. Essentially they had a locker and a bag of clothes that wreaked a odor that was best described as a Sharpie. We did a great deal of air monitoring and investigating and received positive indications on our PID and confirm the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon. Not really sure how to explain this we made contact with the family who once we explained we weren't the police agree to let us investigate their house.

When we got there the Sharpie odor was beyond tolerable. Called in a favor got the local engine to stop by with a positive pressure fan and we started venting the house. We found that they had a bed bug issue. Now mind you these are great people who are trying to take care of their family but they're also incredibly poor. They were trying to resolve this with we will call an old-school fix from the home country. Their contact recommended they mix it with gasoline and spray it what they didn't tell them was not to do this inside their house. So they covered every inch in this creolina and gasoline mixture and had let it sit for about a week. 

Now knowing what caused all this we begin the process of how to remediate. Mind you we are a volunteer service but we still charge for our services. Lucky for them I have a board position and convince them to write this one off as a gift to the community (IIRC the total for this would have been close to $20,000 hazmat is not cheap and this was time and resource consuming). From there we started making contacts spoke with some of the chemist we know and found the only way to really resolve this was with a ozone generator. 

So I called up a friend of mine who happens to also be on the team and he had a contact who managed to donate an ozone generator for a couple days to clean the house which also is apparently toxic to not just humans but bed bugs. I made a few calls to some of my friend's in Health and Human Service and got them a three-day voucher to a local Motel it's not a pretty Motel but they couldn't be in the house during the time. 

Call in a few favors and got them all new clothes and bedding and a new set of beds.

dr1gfw0,dr1ib9d,"Ahhh. Mothers in law and bed bugs. Let me share mine. 

Over summer we went to visit the inlaws out in their state. It was just for a couple of days and they are divorced, so there is two sets. So you can imagine it’s  a hectic travel pitch.  We were supposed to stay with one set a single night, but since she has cats and I’m severely allergic, we offered to get a hotel nearby just to go sleep and shower at. But the MiL insisted that she pick up the hotel for us. I tried arguing, but to no avail. We got to the hotel and it seemed nice. But a few days later when we returned we found them. 

FUCKERS!!!!!
My wife was covered, like someone stated above, she looked like a meth head, scratching all over and with sores on her arms. I wasn’t having it.  It was summer still, I hadn’t started school yet. It was on. I went down to Failmart and bought $50 of Permethrin.  I did our beds, our blankets, pillows, boxsprings, bedskirts, our couches. I sprayed down our closets with our clothes, our drawers. With the last of it I diluted it a bit (there was still quite a fair bit left) and did our carpets. 

No bites since. Plus it was fun to watch flies land on my couch, and then die after a couple of seconds. 
And those inlaws never again, are in charge of picking hotels. ",Negative

dr1gv3z,dr1hrm4,How old is your son? 13 is the age of being able to decide who he wants to live with. Also...does your son react to the bedbugs? You documenting the fact that he doesnt give a sh#t about your or your childs safety and health might sway a judge to give you full custody. Get a consultation w a lawyer. Many offer free consults. Document with a doctor . Their reports are admisable in court. Did you read a person in this thread saying they got rid of them with diatomaceous earth? 20$ worth was all it took.

dr1iej9,dr1lu87,"This, can't stress this enough. A huge bag of DE can be bought at Home Depot for less than 10$. It basically shreds the little fuckers at a microscopic level and dries them out to death. Turns everything you coat in the equivalent of the Sahara desert for them. What I ended up doing that worked the best was getting a face mask and goggles, and then using a shop vac on reverse to blow the very light powder that is DE into every nook and cranny. It also kicked up enough DE in the air that it covered literally everything in the room everywhere once the dust settled (hence needing the dust mask and goggles). It clings to EVERYTHING, but is non-toxic to humans and pets, and can be brushed off or wiped down fairly easily.

The only downside is that it can be really hard to get the eggs, as they lay them in all the little hard to reach crevices. I eventually went with professional treatment for that for peace of mind more than anything, but they said there weren't many left by that time.

Wash any and all clothes stored anywhere near where bedbugs have been sighted, and then store them in sealed plastic bags or containers. Bedbugs can and will hide in clothes and dressers near your sleeping or sitting areas. Dust the fuck out of these areas inside and out.

Last but not least, they can also lay dormant for something like 6 months to a year, so if you want to keep your current bed at all you need to buy bedbug proof mattress covers at your nearest Walmart. This keeps any lingering ones sealed in and helps prevent re-infestation. ",Negative

Diatemecous  Earth (check a pet supplies store with fish because it's used for fish tanks), borax, Satanic rituals, heat treatment... The professional heat treatment uses industrial strength heaters to raise the temperature of the infected rooms to kill the bugs and eggs. There are DIY instructions. You can use electric space heaters. Just be careful of kerosene heaters, because if not properly vented, they will fill the room with Carbon Monoxide. It would be tragic if anyone got CO2 poisoning, wouldn't it.",Positive

dr1gw13,dr1ijgy,"Where do YOU work? My last job had bed bugs multiple times while I worked there and would not listen to my reports that I was being bitten because ""no one else was"" which I later found out to be a lie. I reported a woman who openly admitted having them at home and they did nothing. The first time they only treated because we started calling OSHA. The second time, they didn't even tell people that was what they were treating for. When I finally brought them home, I quit. Unbelievably, I found an amazing pet-safe spray on Amazon that definitely killed them. We only found 8-10 of them, thank god, and we left plenty of the spray behind where they where hiding and I haven't seen one since (it's been about 7 months). We've even checked for them again and nothing. I know they can lie dormant longer than that, so we periodically spray their hiding places again just in case any wake up, but I'm pretty positive they're gone. It was awful.

Edit: Several people asked for the link for the product I used, here it is: Bed Bug Killer by EcoRaider 16 oz, Fast and Sure Kill with Extended Residual Protection, Natural & Non-Toxic, Child & Pet Friendly https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0077CPANQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_OmwlAbBBYTS18 We had a lot of fun spraying it directly on them and watching them to weird little handstands to try to get out of it as they died what looked like the horrible, painful deaths they deserved.

Edit 2: I did also get a bed bug cover for our mattress to prevent them laying eggs there but I'm not sure whether that made much difference or not, wouldn't hurt, I think. It's actually pretty great to have because they're water proof and my fiance has a horrible habit of spilling drinks in bed.",Negative
