dr0xq1z,dr0zs3o,">A young Kenobi movie has way more potential

I disagree, a young Kenobi movie would have to be before Phantom Menace.  When there were no Sith in the open, and no great threat.  It would have to be a pretty generic movie about him facing a threat that wasn't important to the later stories.  Plus, Liam Neeson is quite a bit older than he was in the Phantom Menace, so while not impossible it would be odd for him to reprise the role of Qui-Gon Jinn.

But, with a 20 year gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope there is time for adventures for Obi Wan.  It could be that an Imperial Officer or Inquisitor discovers information about Luke and Obi-Wan has to stop him before he can take the information to the Emperor.  Or the settlement Luke is in could become the target of a crime syndicate and Obi-Wan has to fight them.  Or to tie the film into the sequels, Luke could catch the attention of someone affiliated with Snoke.  

*Edit:  Thinking about it more, I think this idea would annoy some people but depending on how he is portrayed in the Last Jedi, I would enjoy seeing Obi-Wan face off against a young Snoke.  Perhaps Obi-Wan being the source of Snoke's giant scar.  It would also be fun if it turns out Obi-Wan disfigured three of the most powerful dark side users: Maul, Vader and Snoke.*",Positive

For all we know, other mutants could be hiding and use the exposure of this program as a way to unite the remaining mutants to take on the humans, who no longer have a benevolent mutant leader like Xavier to keep them in check.



We really don't know what's at stake here because of the lack of information, which helps keep the movie focused on the small group of characters in the film and makes the stakes seem smaller. Maybe the kids cross into Canada and live pretty normal lives in hiding? Maybe they resurrect Apocalypse and bring doom to the humans? Maybe they starve to death wandering in the wilderness?

And when we accept a possible outcome as a real possibility we suddenly care. 

With that in mind, a story of Obi-Wan protecting baby Luke and the Lars ranch just won't be good. We know what happens. 

But a story about someone like Satine (which I love that they named her that in Star Wars, as Ewan did Moulin Rouge during the prequels and Nicole Kidman's character was named Satine) and their romance/drama would be so much more interesting as her life or death doesn't matter to the main story. It only matters to Obi-wan- so we would care much more, and the outcomes would make us engaged.

I think there's merit in both, because the Obi-wan you see in New Hope is so steadfast in his beliefs that he's willing to let himself be curious down to bide them some time.

And in his struggles, he sees his old master, who convinces him to find a way to do his duty to the Jedi, but not to give up. This helps Obi-wan to solve whatever problem he's facing, but not as a Jedi, so that he doesn't blow his cover. 

This way Obi-wan, instead of just killing all the gang members and succumbing to the dark side, he is convinced to ""Seven Samurai"" the gang. He trains people, he fights back as he did when he was a general. 

At the end, Qui-gon returns to tell him he's proud of him, Obi-wan doesn't feel it that way, but he agrees to follow the Order still. 

There's so goddamn much they could do. ",Positive
