      "I've dealt with Jeremy Christian twice. I used to work Loss Prevention for Whole Foods. One time he was walking around the Hollywood store, screaming out loud and being disruptive. I don't remember exactly what was said aside from some racist BS and tons of swearing. I kicked him out of the store. I remember very clearly being as calm as I could with him and asked him to leave. He pointed directly at me and yelled \"There is a nigger right here!\". I am white. I remained calm and got him to leave. On his way out he screamed \"Fuck this dumb nigger\" pointing directly at me. When we got into the street away from customers he kept acting as if he was going to go back in and I kept stepping in his way until the police arrived. The police spoke with him and sent him on his way and said \"if he comes back give us a call\". I don't think he had a weapon on him then, I was lucky. The other time he stole some hot food from the Pearl store. I went to stop him and he immediately started screaming at me, \"fuck you\" and the like. I stupidly grabbed the food from his hands and he walked off while screaming obscenities. I called the police to let them know and they said they would check it out and I never heard from them.\n",
