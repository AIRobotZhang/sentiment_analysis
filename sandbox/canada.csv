I would suggest you redo this using Statistics Canada’s CMA list, which uses a [consistent criteria to define metropolitan area](
http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/geo009-eng.cfm):

I used wikipedia’s list for CMAs because it’s better organized but you should be able to double check with Stats Can. CMA populations can be found [here](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/fogs-spg/Facts-CMA-Eng.cfm?TOPIC=1&LANG=Eng&GK=CMA&GC=825) on the stats can website but you have to do quite a bit of digging and scrolling, since CMA populations are only by province, are at the bottom of each CMA’s population page and for whatever reason defaults to Education when you select a CMA.

Then we determined that Beijing + Shanghai combined have about 5 million more people than all of Canada. Her mind was absolutely blown. 

We also talked about home sizes - I live in about 465 sf which is of course insanely tiny by Canadian standards and most people find appalling. I told her that and she had the same reaction as most people do (“WHAAAAT?”) However it was a little further into the convo that I realised she was amazed that I lived alone in a place so BIG.

As you can see, it doesn't really change the size of the line ;)

Also, I missed out Greater Sudbury, and now I feel bad. Sorry Sudbury folk.

I used the latest available data, mostly from here, which seems to generally be 2016 Census data, so will have a changed a bit since then: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_100_largest_population_centres_in_Canada

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area

Which in turn sourced data from here:
http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=801&SR=1&S=3&O=D&RPP=25&PR=0&CMA=0#tPopDwell

The figures are for metropolitan areas if every possible case, and with Toronto I made the decison to include Oshawa/Whitby.

Montreal's population includes the surrounding metro area. As does Vancouver's, Calgary's, Edmonton's and so on. 

Tool used: http://sankeymatic.com/build/

The tool can be a bit finicky with the lines, so the diagram is ordered this way (rather than by size or geographically) only because any other way seemed to produce annoying overlaps.

THat's irrelevant, the equalization program is a federal program and as such the income tax we are talking about is only the federal one. Dude from alberta earning 115k pays less in federal income tax then dude in Quebec earning 120k does.

The Quebec population contributes more (barely) then Alberta does to the federal revenues. Ontario pays the most.
