7ipz81,dr0loqs,Cool! Nice job. I recently downloaded all my Google data using [Google takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) and it gives you a big archive in mbox format that this kind of thing would be useful for. You can also use mutt if you're old school ,Positive
7ipz81,dr0p39r,Why did you decide to output CSV instead of Maildir?,Positive
7ipz81,dr0wj54,That's awesome. I'll probably be using this soon. I need it to look for specific emails and make an entry into an Excel sheet with text gathered in the body. This should give me a good start,Positive
7ipz81,dr0zr0z,A cool project could be to use machine learning to predict a subject from a body of text using the emails as training data.,Positive
dr0loqs,dr0qzec,Why doesnâ€™t take out offer gmail for me?,Negative
