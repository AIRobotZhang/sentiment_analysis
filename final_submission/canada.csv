You are lucky to live in a neighbourhood where everyone is so friendly, but that doesn’t represent Canada, just the neighbourhood you live in. The past two neighbourhoods I’ve lived in, nobody talked to each other. If you were to ask for an egg or to borrow a shovel, they’d say no. They had no respect for any of their neighbours. They’d play extremely loud music during the day knowing their neighbour worked from home. One would let their vicious dog outside unattended without a leash, letting him attack a newspaper delivery girl and sending her to the hospital. One time someone’s kid made a habit out of stealing our (important) mail, and instead of saying sorry and returning it, they got mad at us.

I didn't see the amount of homeless like I do see in Portland even though the populations are different like woah.

 You think Americans are happy? Some are, yes, some people are especially good at masking their worries. Even though I'm on the west coast and I'm in the ""chill, laid back"" part of the country, it's still a go go go OMG we gotta do x y z and compete with everybody else for everything. 

There's significant deep cultural differences just talking one slice, about classism. I'm dating a wonderful dude who comes from a well to do family and he has had to never worry about being hungry, access to anything he ever wanted in his life, special classes and opportunities to travel the world and better connections than I. 

He has a very hard time processing me being homeless before, being in debt for over a quarter million dollars from having cancer, working 2 jobs and going to school full time and yet still needing to take out student loans and still can't afford to turn on my heat this winter. The government stopped giving food stamps to FT students because budget cuts, government is trying to strip down our safety net.

Now, with the Tax Plan in the works, I will never be able to support myself if I went to grad school. 

If I had the financial means I'd immigrate but that's just not a reality for me right now. 

If you met me in person, I'm the most optimistic cheery person who is hardly affected by much of anything considering the abuse and horror I've been through. But you'd never be able to tell because I'm a super pro at hiding it, nay, I have to hide it because people discriminate against people like me. 

Anedoctal evidence, yes, but it's my story and I come from a family who's stuck in a cycle of poverty that they can't escape, didn't have access to opportunities or even a good standard education or folks telling them that they can go to college. 

I think if I didn't have to worry about paying for healthcare, I think my life would be significantly less stressed. It it always a hanging fear over my head that I'll get cancer again and have to declare bankruptcy over it.

This _really_ depends. There are many ways to apply to most countries. If you've got ancestry in a European country, it's often trivial to apply and get EU citizenship.

Also, simply getting invited for residency in Canada can be tough.

Of course, if you're wealthy, most countries have a fast track available for immigrants of ""economic interest"".

Here, I feel like everyone is just ready to strike a conversation at any time. (Generalizing, of course) If you ask directions to someone they'll almost always start a conversation and seem genuinely happy. My dad is the best example for this, wherever we go, he'll start talking to people, and as far as I can remember, everyone were gladly having a conversation with him, no one ever was in a bad mood or something, I really like this about my country. Just talk with people around, neighbors, strangers, etc.. I also love how everyone is always ready to help everyone around. Today for example, we have a huge blizzard in Quebec. Twice today I've went out, grabbed a shovel and plowed the parking lot of my condo. They do pay me to do the small sidewalk and clean the area like a janitor, but my point is that I've started plowing the snow around all 15-18 cars in my parking lot and this old man started helping me to get people's cars out and putting gravel on the ground and such. 

I really do not know how to make it short, but I love my country, I love how people are genuine and generous when it comes to helping each other out ! 

At least, this is the point of view from someone living in Quebec. Other provinces seem to dislike us pretty badly due to our very specific group of ""pure-laine"" French speaking Quebecers (my family is unfortunately part of it) who really dislike our English population. By ""pure-laine"", I mean those people yelling loudly about how ""Quebec is a French speaking province so speak French !"". We're not all that bad though !",Positive
