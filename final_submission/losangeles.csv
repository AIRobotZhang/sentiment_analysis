7jc00k,dr5hm7b,"Ok I'm usually not this stupid but how can I download this?
The imgur link takes me to a really low res version and the link to the creator's site doesn't let me long press to download. I'm on mobile btw


Update! My phone now lets me long press and download from original site. I wonder if there's a high res version though",Negative

or is it more from the west and then kind of irrelevant?",Negative
