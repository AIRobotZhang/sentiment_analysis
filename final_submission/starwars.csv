7jix8a,dr6qhf8,Tweet at Mark Hammill- he's pretty good about stuff like this ,Positive
7jix8a,dr6t40p,I've seen so many people dying of cancer that have wishes like this. Someone at star wars should start a not for profit charity so they can focus full time on making stuff like this happen for those in need. ,Negative
7jix8a,dr6t391,"But doesn't the movie come out the next few days anyways? I don't want to be mean or anything, but wouldn't it be more helpful to ask a local cinema for a private screening or something if he needs special assistance?",Positive
7jix8a,dr6rcmf,Everyone tweet this at the actors/directors!,Positive
7jix8a,dr6wc3w,"Send it to Kathleen Kennedy, it would be a good public affairs/outreach piece for Disney",Positive
7jix8a,dr6zmrb,"I am more than certain that if this reaches the right people, it will happen no problems. Do your thing reddit. ",Positive
7jix8a,dr6zed3,"Wasnâ€™t this the plot of Fanboys?  Regardless, I agree with other posters to tweet at Hammill or Disney PR of some flavor!  I so hope Patrick gets his wish!",Negative
7jix8a,dr6x6d4,"This worked for my friend Daniel fleetwood, when the force awakens was about to come out. Tweet JJ Abrams and the whole crew. Iâ€™ll send a tweet out for pat! 

On a personal level, thinking about pat and his family. Wish them the best in light of a bad situation. ",Positive
7jix8a,dr6xvay,"The movie comes out tomorrow, just pirate it ",Positive
7jix8a,dr70a8j,This needs to happen. All the best from germany!,Positive
7jix8a,dr70cqu,The fan will be pissed when heâ€™s left with a bigger cliffhanger than TFA. ,Negative
7jix8a,dr70eax,Wasn't there a member of reddit who arranged this when TFA came out? I just remember someone having connections to lucasfilm.,Negative
7jix8a,dr70ewj,"If astronuts can see it in space, surely this guy can see it in a hospital",Positive
7jix8a,dr6zfxc,I saw that movie... it was called Fanboys.  I give it a B+.,Positive
7jix8a,dr704e0,"i'm dying too, the doctors said i have 50-60 years left. can i watch star wars early too please?",Negative
7jix8a,dr6z74b,"If the outrage is anything to go by, all you'll do is finish him off.",Positive
7jix8a,dr6xw4s,This movie could kill him from disappointment tbh ðŸ˜•,Negative
7jix8a,dr6zxp8,so then this sub will be sick SW fans begging for attention!,Negative
dr6t40p,dr6w8y4,"My wife is a Charity Liason for Rebel Legion. They do private screenings for terminal patients, but they like to keep the screenings truly private. They don't like to make a big deal out of them in the press. Having a media circus isn't really considerate for the family or the terminal patient.

So Lucasfilm and the fan groups do try to step in for situations like this. But you're not meant to hear anything when they do.",Negative
dr6t40p,dr700ct,I'm pretty sure that's the whole idea behind Make A Wish.,Positive
dr6t40p,dr6vex7,"Someone at Lucas Films? Someone at Disney?
",Negative
dr6t391,dr6uyf1,I think the issue is he cannot make it to the theatre (according to the post). I imagine someone would have to make a copy available for screening at the hospital.,Negative
dr6zed3,dr6zndq,A similar thing also happened a few years ago with TFA. #ForceForDaniel.,Positive
dr6zed3,dr70esc,I love Fanboys. Great movie,Positive
dr6xvay,dr6yl6w,"Nobody wants to watch a shitty cam rip on their death bed.  If I'm about to die, I need 4K and 7.1 surrond mother fucker!!",Negative
dr6xvay,dr6zuor,"Yeah, will definitely do that for him if we can't figure anything else out.  But I think he deserves better than some cheap copy shot on a shaky handicam.  At the very least, makes me feel better trying to get him better than that since there's really not a whole lot else I can do.",Negative
dr6xvay,dr6zxah,"Have you even looked at the state of piracy these days? There aren't many screener releases, and if it's a big name movie like Star Wars, don't expect a good copy until the Blu-ray is nearly out.

I've looked at the state of Disney's movies and piracy, they have their shit locked down. Maybe someone gets lucky in an empty theater and sets up their phone, it's still going to be shitty, washed out, terrible audio, etc. The soonest you'll see a decent copy is probably late march early april.",Negative
dr704e0,dr709qc,"lol
",Positive
dr704e0,dr70i5y,"Doesn't need to be early (hopefully).  He's got some time left, just can't leave the hospital.  I don't have any experience screening things or a way to get a decent copy of the film yet or I'd just try and rent the equipment and set it up, which still might happen if someone with more experience in these things can't help us out.

I just don't feel comfortable setting up tons of equipment in a hospital, but I'll figure it out if it's his only option left.",Negative
dr6z74b,dr709j7,What outrage?,Positive
dr6xw4s,dr6z3i7,"How so. If it's anything like tfa which is my favorite one it will be amazing
",Positive
dr6vex7,dr6zxss,"Yo, I don't understand why this is getting downvoted. Disney's got the money. It'd be beyond cool if they did something like this.",Negative
dr6uyf1,dr704jo,They should just stream it to him and to the ISS astronauts at the same time.,Positive
dr6zndq,dr6zz96,"And they gave him a showing, right? Hopeful that this dude will get the same response.",Positive
dr6yl6w,dr6zkbh,"And Mark Hamill holding my hand, the whole way. ",Positive
dr6zxah,dr70hvn,"> Maybe someone gets lucky in an empty theater 

I doubt it with this movie. I bought my tickets when they first went on sale. My friends finally decided to do so now, they can't find a showing for the next week for two-four people together.",Negative
dr6zxah,dr6zzfv,I havenâ€™t watched a pirated movie since high school lol,Negative
dr709j7,dr70g0g,nothing,Negative
dr6zkbh,dr70f93,Talking like the Joker,Positive
dr6zzfv,dr70de1,"Well, when pirated copies pops up... it's either a cam (complete shit usually), a screener copy which is not even 720p, or the movie is completely leaked which rarely happens. 
",Negative
