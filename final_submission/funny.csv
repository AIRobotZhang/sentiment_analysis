2. Take a river boat ride in the evening/night (around 8PM).It is fucking gorgeous with all the lights and chants coming at you, as you gently paddle through and finish your beer.  
3. Varanasi has amazing history. The place they burn the bodies is considered pretty important - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harishchandra

From India to Persia, went into the hands of Anquetil Duperron, the French (?) ambassador in the Persian Court. He translated into Latin, and this reached Europe by the mid 1700s, I think. And that's how the German philosophers got their hands on it. Schopenhauer et al. Its a fascinating story ...       
But Aurangzeb was too hungry. Dara Shikoh escaped in the direction of Afghanistan, his final destination Persia. But at the Indus river, the boatmen had already been warned and they captured him. And got him all the way back to Delhi. Where he was put in a cage and taken through the streets. And finally killed. Another fascinating story ...    
Makes you think. An age when Persia was more liberal than India!",Negative
dr6ouh9,dr6t8d9,"It was rivalry between all sons of Shah Jahan, not just Aurangzeb and Dara Sikoh. Dara was just the last one to fall. It was a Mughal tradition that the crown didn't just pass to the eldest son but rather was won by a claimant by defeating all the rest. Shah Jahan himself had all his brothers/cousins murdered before he took the crown for himself.",Negative
dr6kd8t,dr6l38p,Went to Taj a couple weeks ago. Apparently he forbid the workers from doing the same work or passing on their trade to their children and promised to provide for them and their future generations if they wouldn’t create any similar work. The people complained that they would lose their craft which would be the same as them having their hands cut off.,Negative
dr6kd8t,dr6l0uk,"Yeah his intention was basically that they built such magnificent structure and he didn't want the beauty of Taj to be parallel to any structure built by the workers anywhere, he gave them immense wealth and cut their hands, still a wierd way of appreciation!!! ",Negative
dr6kd8t,dr6v7c7,"Yeah, that story doesn't even make sense. It's not like you can just up and copy the Taj Mahal, you need the resources of an empire for such an extravagant project. ",Positive

Meaning? ",Positive
dr6q5qb,dr6z7cl,"From what I know Persia was quite a liberal country! Apparently they even offered everyone to surrender to them, keep their political positions and basically leave them alone as long as they stay surrendered and listen IF something is demanded. That's quite a nice offer considering the time and force of the persian army. (Somewhere in hardcore history by Dan Carlin)
