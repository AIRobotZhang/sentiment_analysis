7jgds2,dr6bbw9,"Moore is signaling he might pursue a recount. However, Jones' lead is a 1.5% margin, not .5% of a percentage point, so no automatic recount will be triggered unless Moore's campaign pays for it. Even if all the military ballots go to Moore, he still wouldn't be close to triggering the automatic recount. Alabama's Sec of State (Republican) has signaled that the democratic win will be certified on the 26th of Dec. The President has conceded, and Moore will definitely be the odd man out if he continues pursuing a recount. This is a big day for Alabama, and the country, congratulations Senator Jones.

With only 51 Republican senators, passing any legislation and getting nominations confirmed now gets even harder for Republicans. Three Republican senators combined to kill the Obamacare repeal. Now, the party has to get all but two of its members behind any initiative it wants to pass.

One of the important features of the Jones-Moore campaign is that even though the Democrat was running in a heavily Republican state, he was not forced to take any stands that really differ from Democratic orthodoxy. He made no specific commitments to back any part of Trump’s agenda. He is likely to be the 49th “no” vote on most Trump initiatives.

And Jones will have this seat until Nov. 2020, so he will not face much immediate electoral pressure. He can, at least for a bit, be more liberal on issues than senators like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, who is up for election this coming November.

Like when the German war machine was panzerfucking europe and we needed an unbreakable code, the Navajo were all like ""Hey, you know what, we speak a completely undecipherable language that is thousands of years old. You seem pretty cool, we'll give you all of our intelligent young men. I hope you return the favor."" And they went out and fought and died and they defeated the german and Japanese empire. And when the government rounded up and imprisoned all the Japanese and sent them to Heart Mountain Concentration Camp, the Japanese Americans said ""Here are all our young men, they will fight for you."" - and they became the most decorated unit in the entirety of World War II, surpassing every white unit in the entire army that has ever fought in any war. And in 2017, in Alabama, the black community came out in huge numbers in support of the candidate who was not a pedophile. OK. Hang on. That might be just, um, pretty much a normal thing to do. You know. Black or white. If you don't like pedophiles or child molesters. Or if you do, but just don't want some crazy fuckwit who has been fired from every real job he's ever had making laws.

dr68fpp,dr6a0h7,This is 100% written by Trump’s handler.,Negative
dr68fpp,dr6abs7,"My first thought when I saw that tweet was ""there's not a fucking chance he wrote that."" 

Trumps probably so enraged right now that either a) the top of his head has actually popped off, or b) he's curled on the floor of the residence, in a fetal position, shaking like he's having a seizure, while gripping his ~~shitposting device~~ 
cell phone so hard that he's actually cracked the screen. ",Negative
dr68fpp,dr69ne8,Definitely not written by him. I can’t even read that in his voice.,Negative
dr68fpp,dr698fh,Without a doubt was written for him. That’s calm and restrained. ,Positive
dr68fpp,dr6ae5n,"I saw that too, you can guarantee it was written by someone else, it's too articulate and respectful to be a Trump tweet, plus it wasn't done at 5am when he takes his 2 hour diet coke shit (5 min to poo and 115 min to wipe).

Wait for the tweets tomorrow morning, that'll tell us all we need to know",Negative
dr68kqn,dr6azs4,That was definitely not written by him. There aren't any words that are arbitrarily capitalized.,Negative

dr69khe,dr6babw,"I read somewhere that conservatives' old scapegoats (homosexual, atheist, minority, etc) weren't working, which is why pedophilia has suddenly become the accusation of choice. They chose a bad year to back an actual pedophile.",Negative
dr67nyo,dr68lqb,"All it took in Alabama was a child rapist, so this will be easier. ",Positive
dr67nyo,dr67tqa,"By like a twenty point margin, and Cruz isn’t exactly popular amongst all Republicans last I checked. If Texas elects Beto next year it very well be a swing state in presidential elections as well, which is even more exciting than a victory in the Senate. Getting Cruz unseated might even mean someone could unseat Cornyn like one of the Castro brothers or Wendy Davis maybe. ",Positive

dr672ce,dr68dek,"Yep, but those two years are huge.  at least buys D’s some time to win elsewhere in two more elections, and importantly in a presidential year where D’s usually get better voter turnout.",Positive
dr672a3,dr68txk,"Well...

That democrat they elected in 1994 is still the the other state senator...

He just happened to switch parties.",Negative
dr66zlo,dr673mn,"If the Dems allow him to swing pro-life a little (or ""come out as"" pro-life), I think he's got a shot. Don't mean the party establishment but the voters who won it for him tonight. If they still keep voting for him and he's able to lose some of the stigma of being not-quite-pro-life, he has a much easier path.",Neutral
dr665hj,dr66gr1,This is amazing.   This is going to make the GOP freak out.   Watch Trumps tweets!!!!,Positive
dr66wz8,dr67anx,"If we want people to show up, maybe we shouldn't hold our elections during working hours on a Tuesday? 

Most public events try to take place either on the weekend or in the evenings. That's why you have, for example, Monday Night Football, or Saturday Morning Cartoons. 

What other event of national importance takes place on a Tuesday afternoon?",Positive

dr6685l,dr66olk,"Plus... if Ds can win in Alabama, literally every state in the country is in play. Granted, Moore was uniquely horrible, but the strong black vote and diminished GOP turnout can be replicated a lot of places (see: Virginia).

I think Tennessee is a toss up with Bredesen running since he's so well liked.

dr67k34,dr680hu,"Additionally, vote-by-mail should be allowed everywhere, with no special reason required. People who work emergency services, people who are on vacation, whatever the reason is, they should vote.

Furthermore, for those soooooo concerned about requiring everyone have voter ID: sure. Everyone gets a voter ID sent in the mail, for free, at age 18. Hell, maybe an emailed copy too, for those voting by mail. Hell, maybe an app on your phone to display the voter ID that can be accepted at the ballot box. And anyone can request a free voter ID any time, should they lose theirs.

Would be funny to see how the people who are truly concerned by fraud are totally happy with this, while the people who push the agenda at the high level are pissed off but can't show it, so they hide behind things like it costing money to develop and maintain such a system, and other bullshit complaints.",Positive
