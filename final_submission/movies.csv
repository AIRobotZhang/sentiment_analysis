Maybe Vaughn should stick more to creating one off movies like First-Class, Kick-ass or even the first Kingsman could have been.

I mean, they'd already logick'd themselves out of shooting him in the head, couldn't they have sped up the process of truly bringing him back like they did only 30 minutes later for Whiskey? Colin Firth, to me, was one of the biggest reasons why the first film worked as well as it did; Harry carried the movie until Eggsy was ready to do that himself, and bringing him back the way they did, only to have him just sitting there, useless, felt like such a cock-tease that was almost unnecessary.](#spoiler)Oh, and how could I forget about [killing off Roxy! I know that was heavily implied from the trailers, but I assumed it was a misdirect, because they wouldn't actually do that to her character, would they? I'd really hoped that she'd have played a much bigger role this time around, seeing as how she was the one who was named Lancelot, was a full-fledged Kingsman agent, and Eggsy's closest friend. But, nope: she'd served her usefulness in blowing something up in the less-exciting part of the plan to save the world, and she was no longer necessary, delegating her character forever to the category of ""Useless Protagonist."" That is, unless they really go for broke and come up with an even more contrived way to explain how she survived that explosion and was in hiding. I can't really see them doing that, as they brought back Charlie (who was presumed dead) and Harry (who should be dead), and if they keep it up then they're no longer satirizing those tropes, but actively relying on them.](#spoiler)^(As was pointed out, this was actually fairly well explained, I'd just forgotten about it)",Negative

Personally I think expanding the universe was a good way to go about it and introducing a different branch of kingsmen was a smart way to do that imo. The action scenes were still very over the top and fun and the same can be said about the villain who was just James Bond-ish enough to keep me hooked. I liked Elton John making his cameo, it was fun and pretty entertaining on the whole.As for Channing Tatum I would agree, his inclusion was meh at best and he really didn't do much at all in the movie with Pedro Pascal being the far more interesting character only to be killed off prematurely imo. What I find interesting going forward is that there is no one in the same mould as Q from the 007 franchise with Merlin dying and Halle Berry becoming a field agent.Overall it was a really good movie but didn't match the excellent first movie. 8/10",Positive

dr6fk8t,dr6otqn,"i honestly never interpreted it that way. i mean, they're kingsmen, they have a bulletproof umbrella, grenade zippos, and many more gadets we can't even begin to think off. if i remember correctly, all we saw is the gun pointed at his face and then the feed cutting out and Harry falling backwards while Valentine and Gazelle are turning away from the ""body"". As long as there is no burial there is always a chance for someone to return. If i remember correctly then they even planned on letting [Merlin](#spoiler) survive and to only show [him](#spoiler) with a prosthetic lower body. They even had this alternate ending shot, but they decided against it.  Thats also the reason why i think that [Roxy survived the explosion](#spoiler). We never saw [her](#spoiler) corpse or any kind of mention that they burried [her](#spoiler).

dr6di5p,dr6epjs,"To be fair, we had plenty of time to prepare from some absurd device or retconning to bring Harry back; as soon as they released that teaser poster last January, with that Mark Twain quote about the stories of his demise being greatly exaggerated, and the pair of glasses with one lens blacked out, it was clear that they were going to have to come up with some way of fixing a point-blank head shot.I was prepped for whatever absurd tech they were going to throw out, but [leaving Harry to just sit for about a quarter of the movie](#spoiler) just made things worse, especially once we saw that the [amnesia could be cured instanteously as we saw with Pedro Pascal's character](#spoiler). I wasn't fully expecting Harry to just suddenly be the same suave, collected man he was, and I actually liked [that they compensated for his lack of depth-perception in that initial bar fight](#spoiler), but he was almost entirely useless right up until the point where he wasn't, which [came completely out of nowhere, as he's suddenly got all his faculties to be the only person among them to suspect WHISKEY could have ulterior motives -- motives, of which, felt so thrown in at the last second. Them handling Harry as poorly as they did is pretty much my biggest gripe.](#spoiler)Listen to me. There I was originally stating how much I liked it the second time around, only to immediately shit on it.For those who haven't seen it, the charm and the chemistry of the characters are still there, and for its several faults with story structure, pacing, and poorly-fleshed-out B-characters, its very much got some of the same heart as the first. Unfortunately, It just seems very likely that Goldman and Vaughn didn't have nearly as clear a vision for how this was supposed to go as they did for the original, but I will say that they did their best to bring back as much of the good stuff as possible to actually make it worth watching. If you go in with tempered expectations (which I definitely did not) you'll likely have a better time.",Negative
dr6ff8s,dr6fr8f,"I was in the ""Leave Him Dead"" camp at first, too, but when I thought more about the entire backbone of the series being a mixture of an homage and satire of the spy genre, bringing a character back from the dead is one of the classics, so it was kind of fitting for them to come up with some contrived way of bringing him back.But you're absolutely right: if they could have kept Firth's involvement under wraps, or at least not come right out and say, ""Hey, Harry's back,"" I think that reveal would have had a much bigger impact overall.",Positive

Zoolander is a great example of cameos used properly.Elton John used up screen time that could have been better spent elsewhere. It make his moments feel cheap, the fights feel less cool. Ultimately K2 feels like a movie where the viewer is asked to tolerate everything about it in order to get to the end. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't.

We got the gradual reveal that not only was Valentine the bad guy, but a total megalomaniac, but all of that happened naturally along with the rest of the plot. The entire movie is densely packed, and fast paced, without so much as a wasted moment or line.But that was completely missing in the sequel. The writing was the biggest culprit, as all the other elements were there. It was just too disjointed, [the US president character made zero sense other than being a somewhat funny, but completely stale, saturation of Trump](#spoiler) and we're thrown right into the middle of Poppy's operation and her sheer level of insanity almost immediately, with zero context. Yeah, they eventually let us non-comic book readers in on a bit of her background, but she was also completely boring. That's not Julian Moore's fault, mind you. In fact, without her, the character would have been even worse, but there was nothing to her goals. Valentine, as batshit crazy as he was, at least laid out some highly-twisted, but believable, reasoning (that was carefully sprinkled into the story almost immediately) for wanting to wipe out a large portion of the human race, and you felt the stakes. But Poppy's plan? Even as we saw the effects of it, [knowing that there was a very simple way of not only administering the antidote, but even getting to it, totally killed whatever stakes they had managed to create.](#spoiler)By that point, we've now had one and a half movies showing us just how formidable even one and three-quarters Kingsman agents are, and what we saw of Poppy's organization made it very clear that they'd tear through the red-shirts without issue, [and that Eggsy would find some gadget-y way to get past Charlie's new tech. Leaving the two robot dogs for which served only to add more time to final battle, and then we're left with Poppy, who had no backups or Plan Bs. Unlike Gazelle in the first one, her bodyguard was a Kingsman washout who had already been defeated by the very people she was trying to outsmart, so as soon as I saw that the answer to everything was her laptop](#spoiler), all the suspense was gone because they'd already painted such a vivid picture of how good the Kingsman are, and just how wildly understaffed and unprepared Poppy really was.We always expect the good guys to win in these kind of stories, so my point isn't that this shouldn't have been the case, but at least make me question whether or not it's possible the evil genius' plot could actually work (""This ain't the kind of movie"" type of playing with the tropes like they did the last time around), or, better yet, just make the journey so much fun that I don't care nearly as much about the destination as much.",Negative
